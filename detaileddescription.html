          <h1 class="mb-4 section-title">Aims</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="pt-2 pb-lg-5">

                    <p>The ultimate goal of our project is to make a convenient and efficient recycling guide that the user can utilise for their inquired items. Specifically, the user would be able to search up the item using its name, classification, by scanning its barcode or using the in-built AI to scan the item itself and receive recycling suggestions along with nearby recycling bins via the software. In order to achieve our ultimate goal, we have divided it into smaller manageable goals:
                      <br> <br><br>

                    <i><h6>1. Create a database relationship and build a database.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                     Since the app we are designing requires it to store data and multiple functions would require accessing the database, we need to establish the foundational database relationships in order to link the relevant tables at the start. By setting the Primary Key, Foreign Key and Item Name into the table in advance would help the developer accurately query the data into the database during the subsequent program development stage.
                    <br><br><br>

                    <i><h6>2. Designing the user interface where the user is able to login and retain user data in the database.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    Creating an account system would increase user experience as it allows the user to have more freedom in personalising their own account. But in this mini-goal, the main priority is to allow the user to create an account and login with the corresponding account which would require designing a user interface that allows this feature to access the database to store and read account information which would achieve the registration and login functions.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>3. Ability of the app to scan or read barcodes via camera or photo.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    The goal for this step is to allow the app to be able to read the item’s barcode via the user’s mobile device by using the device’s camera or a photo in the device’s photo library.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>4. App is able to use the scanned barcode to search the database and output recycling suggestions.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    After achieving the previous mini-goal, our next step is to create a function that allows the app to utilise the scanned barcode to find the appropriate recycling guide in the database.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>5. Creating a search function.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    In some cases, users may already have knowledge about the item type or name and would just like to get recycling advice for these items so the goal for this step would be for us to create a search function that would allow the user to directly search the item up.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>6. Allowing the app to utilise GPS to locate nearby recycling bins.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    People would always choose the method that is most convenient to them, an example would be throwing items that they know would come under recyclables into landfill waste because they are unable to find a recycling bin and this would be the most convenient for them. For this step, our goal is to allow the app to utilise the in-built GPS on the user’s mobile device to show nearby recycling bins which would make it easier for users to find these bins and further improve recycling rates.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>7. Creating an Artificial Intelligence model.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    To increase better convenience and user experience, we decided to develop a basic AI that would be able to identify all types of waste that could be recycled by using pictures.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>8. Collect data to train the AI.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    In order for the AI to work properly, we would need to collect and classify some pictures of recyclable items and train AI models for that.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <i><h6>9. Ability of the AI to identify some common items.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    After initially training the AI, the next goal would be that the AI will be able to identify some of the recyclable items easily and give the corresponding recycling guide for the identified item.
                    <br><br><br>

                    <i><h6>10. Improving the AI so that it is able to identify more items.</i></h6>
                    <br>
                    Since AI learning is a long-term process, during this process the AI would be able to continually identify more items accurately along the way which would later give a much more accurate recycling guide to the user. Although this would be a long-term goal, due to the progression of AI in the modern world it will bring users a more convenient and efficient way of receiving recycling information.

          <h1 class="mb-4 section-title">Plans & Progress</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="pt-2 pb-lg-5">
                  <p>Our initial project idea was to construct an automatic recycling bin using Arduino in the hopes of improving the environment through recycling, however owing to the enormous number of products available with the same concept, we decided to change the idea for our project. Our weekly progress was hampered as a result of the abrupt change, but our objective remained the same, which was to improve the environment through recycling so that people would be more aware of it.

                    <br><br>
                  So, In this project, we plan to go step by step in the order of smaller manageable goals that were previously mentioned in the aims section in hopes to achieve a final product of a functional app which uses a simplistic amount of data. Next we will be describing in detail about the plans and progress of each goal.
                  <br><br>
                  For our first goal, we started planning out what type of data would be required. After figuring out the type of data, we would need to classify these data types and put those that are relevant into a table which would later be used to build database relationships to create a database that can be networked. In order to achieve this, research on what data would be needed by certain functions would need to be done. These functions include the search function, the account registration and login system, using the scanned barcode to retrieve information and recycling guide and the function that would search nearby recycling bins around the user’s area. During the classification process, we had decided that information regarding the user account and item would be of separate tables and information regarding the geographic locations would be dealt with during the process of making the app able to utilise the in-built GPS.


                  <br><br>
                  After the classification of data types is completed, an online database would needed to be built. Based on our research, we have found two relation database services we could utilise for our database, MongoDB and Amazon RDS, where we established a database instance using the free plan option provided by the two services respectively where MongoDB used an independent data schema and Amazon RDS used a mySQL database. We then proceeded into linking the online database with the app where two methods were found, the first method involved the addition of the official provided driver to the app through the user and security rules set by the server of the database and utilising a special file format to encode in the app so it is able to read and write into the database.  However, this method appends the username and password used by the database into the code of the app which greatly increases the risk of the database being attacked by stolen credentials. The second method was to build an online web via web hosting or a REST API by utilising the API in JSON language to link the database with the app. This method allows us to modify the rules for what can be read or written  so that credentials would not appear in the code of the app.


                  <br><br>

                  Following the set up of the database, the next goal would be designing the User Interface of our mobile app. One of the main priorities in designing our user interface was to ensure that an account system was developed in our mobile app’s user interface, to achieve this, we would first need to pay attention to three fundamental parts that make up a user interface, which are the layout of the interface, the content awareness and the aesthetics. Keeping in mind the three fundamentals, we can use these three fundamentals as our reference guide when researching and designing our UI to see whether we have come to at least a satisfactory design for our UI. We can use tools such as Figma and lucid chart to design the wireframes and Proto.io could be used to visualise the designs for the development process

                  <br><br>
                  Now we can proceed to the next goal for our mobile app which is to have the app be able to scan and read barcodes via the mobile device’s camera or from a photo, the reason for this goal is that it will increase the effectiveness of our app as being able to scan the barcode instead of manually searching is super convenient. In order to achieve this, we did some research on how barcode recognition and registration works and it is done by utilising a live camera feed of a barcode or a photo of a  barcode to filter through the database to retrieve information. Since the app is on mobile devices, this can be done via Android Studio where we could use the live camera feed of a barcode or photo to filter through the database to retrieve and output item information and recycling guide that was previously linked with each other when we were establishing databases and its relationships. In Android Studio, we would later be able to create this function so that it is editable in the cases some barcodes can’t be fully detected due to size or readability along with parameters of the barcode so the app could scan the barcode easily such as making the camera zoom in a little more than usual so it can read the barcode much easier, having a guiding viewfinder on the screen so it would be easier to have the camera focus and recognise all the digits on the barcode. Once the barcode is identified, a pop up will appear indicating the barcode was successfully identified whilst showing the information regarding the scanned item and recycling guide that corresponds to the item.
                  <br><br>
                  We then proceed to the search functionality of the app, where the function would help increase the effectiveness of the app making it more user friendly. As users generally desire an app with easy usability to get the job done rather than an app bloated with features, we plan to build this feature by using react where it will display information on the frontend from the backend by fetching information from the database and filtering the required output with the input which in this case would be the material or item name
                   <br><br>
                   In the front end, we would require a placeholder where we would be able to input the name of the item or material that would be searched. We discovered that we might accomplish this by inputting the name of the item or material concisely and then entering; but, this method has a disadvantage in that users may misspell the name, resulting in the notice "Result not found." To counteract this, we designed the function to begin looping around the results as soon as the user begins entering characters, and the results would begin to appear continuously on the frontend until the user finishes typing or has selected one of the results displayed which would result in a better user-friendly interface.

                  <br><br>
                  Once the barcode scanning function was functioning, we started working on the ability of the app to utilise the GPS to locate recycling bins. We originally planned to import the position of the recycling points into a database, but we discovered that the location of these points belonged to a particular type of data in the database, and owing to our technical inability to handle the data type, we chose to use Google Maps in our app instead. To use Google Maps in our programme to find the bins, we needed to first download the Google Play Services package or the Google Maps Android API v2 Samples repository. We then had to create a Google Cloud Project to allow the Google Maps API to retrieve the API Key and display the map in our app with the marked location that was added by the functions “LatLng arraylist and googleMap”.

                  <br><br>
                  In order to make our app different from our competitors, we implemented a machine learning model or also known as AI into our app. First, we began our machine learning research because we were unfamiliar with how a machine learning model is built and how data is handled by it. We then use the data to integrate the model into our app so that it can recognise a certain image. As we looked deeper, we realised that a standard machine learning model would be insufficient to meet our project's requirements, necessitating the use of a deep learning model based on neural networks, which was much above our capabilities. However, we stumbled upon an AWS service named Amazon Rekognitio.

                  <br><br>
                  Amazon Rekognitio is an AWS service that helps clients to incorporate picture or video analysis to their apps. With the privilege of discovering this service, we were able to construct the model we sought without much code via its custom labels, even though it was only beneficial at the beginning. We were able to construct a model at first since training the model only required a hundred photos, which could be easily saved in our Amazon S3 bucket. So, we'll develop our AI model with Amazon Rekognitio and connect it to the backend so that it can deliver recycling guidance information on the object spotted. Amazon Rekognitio also has thousands of trained models that would eventually come into play after analysing the images saved in the S3 bucket, which decreases the burden compared to developing a model from scratch. However, there is a possibility that the model may be erroneous and incompatible with our other provisions, therefore in the later stages we will need a far more reliable and precise model that will be constructed from the ground up to meet our needs.

                  <br><br>
                  We discovered that we were running a little behind schedule while working on the project. We discovered that we were lacking a number of data points in our database, as well as functionality that notifies the user of whether an item is recyclable or not.

                  <br><br>
                  The Timeframe section discusses how we intend to continue improve our product.

              <div class="pt-2 pb-lg-5">
                <p>To keep the project going, we have defined the following specific roles:
                  <br><br>

                  <h5>Backend developer</h5>
                  <br>
                  To develop the main functionality of the application.
                  We need to do a lot of coding in the process of the project. The development of the back-end is particularly important. It undertakes the function of linking and coordinating with various other areas, and is also the main development area for application function implementation. Depending on the usage situation, it is easy for multiple people to make mistakes in the program, so it is very necessary to set this special role.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Responsibilities</b>
                  <br>
                  -Responsible for the back-end development of the Android side, need to be familiar with Java programming.<br>
                  -Be able to use JDBC, BSON and JSON language for coding.<br>
                  -Ability to communicate well with UI design and database management members.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Basic skills required</b>
                  <br>
                  -Ability to develop mobile applications.<br>

                  <br><br><br>


                  <h5>Front-end developer</h5>
                  <br>
                  Make the interface user friendly so that more and more people can interact with the application.
                  In addition to the development of the back-end, we need professional front-end developers. Front-end developers are mainly responsible for the design and implementation of the user interface, and design and place the functional locations of the program to make the user interface easy to use, full of technology, and able to attract more users. many users. Front-end developers also need to be able to communicate well with back-end developers and implement program functions.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Responsibilities</b>

                  <h5>Database Administrator</h5>
                  <br>
                  Who will be in charge of the database, which means adding, deleting or editing information in the database.
                  The use and setting of the database is designed in our project, which is about how to enter and modify data in the database, as well as the allocation and setting of data tables. The data administrator also needs to be responsible for the security of the database, which involves the communication between the back-end and the database, and the database administrator needs to provide data communication with the back-end that can ensure the security of the database, and can communicate effectively with the back-end developers. The database is monitored and maintained.

                  Testers are a special existence, which can be held by multiple people at the same time, and team members will also take turns serving as testers to test each key process. Testers need to be able to understand the structure and way of running the program, and be able to describe the test in precise language, and be able to point out the problems of the program or make suggestions for the program.

                  Who will make sure our app is running well on air
                  In fact, at the current stage, this seems to be a not very important position, however, because many program functions need to be supported by online databases or programs/services. Therefore, ensuring that these devices are online is very critical for the operation of the application. Once the device that needs to work online goes offline or becomes inaccessible, the application will lose its function, so we decided to list it separately. A member who is not busy with the project can fill this role.

              <i>Tools and Technologies: MongoDB (free plan, M0 Sandbox, 512 MB, version 5.0.8), Amazon RDS (mySQL community with free plan, version 8.0.28), Realm SDK (Java SDK), Connector/J 8.0.29 (mySQL driver), BSON and JSON language, API, Android Studio, Google Map Android API v2, Maps SDK and Google Play Service.</i>
              <br><br>
              In Haosheng's work and research for the database development and connection to the app, it was discovered that two free relational database services, MongoDB and Amazon RDS, could be used with the app. The first option would necessitate the SDK or driver being included into the app via Android studio coding, credentials included. The alternative way entails the creation or presence of an API and the use of JSON to connect the API and the app so that data may be exchanged without the use of credentials.
              <br><br>

              It was also discovered that using Google Maps in our app is relatively simpler because it only requires the implementation of Maps SDK and Google Play Service in Android Studio to activate the Google Map feature in our app where the API and its key would be retrieved from Google so that additional markers to mark recycling positions could be made.
              <br><br><br>

              <i>Tools and Technologies: Android Studio, Proto.io, ML Kit</i>
<br><br>
              Shannon's work and research for the creation of the User Interface and Barcode Recognition revealed that the initial interface development requires a significant amount of coding to accomplish each component that would require design modification. To visualise the design, she proposed using Proto.io, a free prototype service, to build visualisations for the User Interface design and functions that would be built in Android Studio once the design was finalised. It was also established that the installation of barcode recognition within the app would necessitate the use of ML Kit in Android Studio.
<br><br><br>
              <i>Tools and Technologies: React, Amazon Rekognitio</i>
              <br><br>

              It was discovered in Manav's study and research for the development of the search function and AI progression that a tool called React may assist in achieving the search functionality. Along with this, it was discovered that a free service called Amazon Rekognitio could develop and provide AI models without the need for coding from scratch, but it would still require at least a hundred samples in a dataset to train it.
