                  First of all, in assignment 3 we got a new member Haosheng to replace Aditya who was inactive in our last assignment. Haosheng really helped us a lot since there were just 4 members and now it has become 5 active members. Personally, I wish I could’ve done more but we obviously need to share tasks. We all did a good job already and finished the assignment on time. We also made a big mistake in Assignment 2 which made us realise that we should not be careless. To be honest, I couldn’t think of what could be improved, but I know that our organisational skills, teamwork, and time management has improved. We planned our meetings together and  joined meetings regularly when I was available.I managed to help with the entire skills and job section and helped reference the links. Nothing was really surprising as we went through assignments together. It's only normal to improve together as well. Groups really do help lessen the burden of each person, imagine doing the assignments alone. It also helps us with communication and socialising which is very good.

                  <br><br>
                  In My opinion most of the things went well, we all were meeting regularly on regular intervals. We made a good use of collaboration tools unlike last assignment. All the meetings were well planned. One thing I would improve in myself or as a group is asking more questions other than just assuming as there was a case where a person did a part of a report but ended up doing it wrong because he was maybe unsure about it. One surprising thing for me was when we got a new team member, I thought it would be hard to explain to him our past project and our way of doing the assignment, but he reviewed our past assignment well and was able to bond with the team. Moreover, he was aware of some MS teams tools which actually helped us in our collaboration, so having a new member was surely an advantage. One thing I personally learned was That we just ask any doubt we have even if it’s a stupid one as at the later stages it gets really hard if you misunderstood a small things and waste a lot of time on it, instead ask at first and invest your time wisely.

                  <h5>Haosheng</h5>
                  <br><br>
                  During this group assignment, I think our team did a good job of assigning tasks and communicating, and in this collaboration, I was responsible for assigning most of the tasks and making decisions to the team members. I finished the meeting recording documents, the Topic and Motivation section of the project description, Aim, Roles, Scope and Limits, Tools and Technologies in the detailed description, and Databases and Maps in Plans and Progress. Since most of our group members have jobs, the online coordination part I think needs improvement. Most of the time we can only communicate using text messages except for meetings, which is actually very laborious and can be a difficult situation of expression. Besides, there are still some problems in the comprehension of the assignments. The results of the assessment 2 of this group surprised me, and I was impressed with Manav's active performance. I think the group members can learn more about the basic requirements of the assignments through more communication or asking the teacher. Overall, our progress is relatively smooth, if we can do those parts that need improvement, I think the efficiency of this group will be improved a lot.

                  After finishing assignment 2, I was quite anxious once we received the feedback and grades of assignment 2. However, after discussing with the tutor about our final task, I understood what went wrong and felt motivated to achieve well from the outset.. I saw that we were cooperating a lot more seamlessly and transparently with one another while working on assignment 3, and that we were scheduling and planning ahead of time compared to how we worked previously. I also discovered that I was comfortable speaking my thoughts and asking questions with my teammates, which produced a pleasant communicative working atmosphere for me to work in so that we could complete our tasks on time. With the addition of a new team member in the middle of the semester, it was a learning process however I found that we were able to adjust well as we clicked with one another which didn’t create a big difference in the work environment. Personally, I learned that to work well in a group, we must be able to respect others and their thoughts by communicating with one another and to not be insecure and communicate your own personal concerns  in order to work smoothly and successfully.

                  <br><br>
                  Our assignment 2 went really well but we missed some references by mistake which resulted in some deduction of our marks.But now in Assignment 3 we have improved a lot and did everything with more concentration and Manav was leading our group and helping everyone. Through the whole assignment we paid a lot of attention to every section and did it as well as we could. We started the assignment with a new group member, Haosheng, which gave us a boost that now we have 5 members working on our assignment. We did a minimum of 2 meetings every week to match the pace  and discussed everything week-by-week with everyone and asked everyone if they needed help. Everybody did their work on time. After we had our consultation with the lecturer we got quite confident with our assignment and after everybody progressed really well. I really learned a lot in this assignment about how to communicate with new people and how to work in a team, as teamwork is the only thing that matters and helps. We asked all types of questions so that nobody has any problem understanding the criteria of the assignment.From my point of view everybody worked really hard and I really appreciate it a lot.

                  <h5>For the group</h5>
                  <br><br>

                  As a group we all were really demotivated from the feedback we got for our Assignment 2. Our tutor talked to us about us and motivated us for Assignment 3 and each and everyone started to give their 100% from the very start of the assignment. Our Collaboration went well in this assignment as we used multiple collaboration tools like Trello, MS teams’ calendar, MS teams files. Google docs. Also, everyone completed their tasks on time which made everyone feel released throughout the assignment, so no one was pressurised. One thing that can be improved is setting deadlines, though everyone was doing their tasks we never set a deadline for a particular thing which might make everyone plan what they can do for the rest of the time. As our old group from Assignment 2 and new group member, all of us thought it will be hard to adjust but surprisingly we all bonded really well in the first week itself, one thing that surprised was most of the group member didn’t have any experience in using Figma or proto.io that made us a bit delayed for our prototype to design as some members were learning. One thing we all learned is that there is a reason for an assignment to be a group project and while we are working in a group, we need to respect each other’s decision. Everyone has an idea, we all need to sit and evaluate pros and cons before coming to any decision.
