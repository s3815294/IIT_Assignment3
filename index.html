      <h1 class="mb-4 section-title">Team Profile</h1>
      <p class="mb-4">As a team, it is important for members to be able to understand and communicate with each other for a smooth workflow. In order to achieve this, tests such as personality tests can have a big impact as it gives an insight on the behaviours of team members and how they operate on doing tasks. With these tests, not only will it allow us to have an insight and better understanding on how our team members deal with different tasks but it can allow us as individuals to be able to learn and adjust to different personalities and working styles.
        <br><br>

      As seen in the graphs, each of us have different personalities and learning styles and from this we would be able to adjust each of ourselves in order to create a suitable working environment for everyone and assign suitable tasks for each member along with this, the knowledge of each member’s personality (16personalities test) would make us be more sensitive towards other members as the test gives an in-depth detail about each of our personalities resulting in better communication in the team overall. With these leading to each of the members having to learn and adjust, getting better understanding and better communication in the team, this would result in the team producing a product/service to a greater degree.

                    <p class="mb-4">During the last week of our Assignment 2 we realised that during the start we did not plan our meetings on a regular basis which made us do a lot of meetings at the end which also spoiled the schedule of a lot of members as they had to skip prior appointments to attend meetings. We also never used any collaboration tool so until we didn't meet we never knew what other group members had completed.
                          <br><br>
                    We also had a new team member who suggested us some tools to use for our assignment. So, we are using the builtin MS teams feature to plan meetings on time, so everyone gets a reminder on the day they are supposed to meet. We are also using Trello in this assignment so we can make sure we all know at all times what other group members are up to. We will be using google docs to collaborate on the report together like assignment 2. In addition to them we will also be using Figma to design our wireframes and prototype.

                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mb-4 section-title">Career Plans</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">First and foremost, It is obvious that all five of us tend to choose jobs that have a salary above $100,000. It is only normal for people to be attracted to salaries that are relatively high. The second thing is that all the jobs are IT related and also need basic IT and communication skills. Although, the extra skill differs based on the chosen jobs. Winston’s and Tanish’s ideal jobs both have roles that manage a team and manage a certain project/work. On the other hand, both Shannon and Manav’s have roles that analyse data and help people with the given data.
                            <br><br>
                    Some differences include the required skills each person has to learn in order to be qualified for each job. Moreover, the company and environment will certainly be varied as each person works in different companies. Each job will also have its roles and functions that can help our society in different ways. In conclusion, the career plans of each member can’t be put in as “similar”, but can definitely work closely as our jobs would be IT related.
